Load Dataset:

Generate a synthetic dataset with random values for X and a linear relationship for y with added noise.
Combine X and y into a pandas DataFrame.
Split Data:

Use train_test_split to divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Train Model:

Create a linear regression model using LinearRegression from scikit-learn.
Fit the model to the training data.
Evaluate Model:

Make predictions on both training and testing sets.
Calculate and print the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared values for both sets.
Visualize Results:

Plot the regression line along with training and testing data points.
Plot actual vs. predicted values for the testing set to assess the model's performance visually.
